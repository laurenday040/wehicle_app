## Small summary

- This is a small app where you will see 3 filter on the top and a list of different vehicles under them.
- The application was created following best practice possible as S.O.L.I.D principles and Declarative programming.

- The development was mainly focused on using observables and async pipe so there was easier to manage the data streams.
- There is small responsive design for different screen sizes, and the library used was `Tailwind`, the reason was because
  tailwind allow you to attach to build bundle only the classes you used, that makes it a very versatile css library.
  For testing I used ng-mock and observer-spy, feel like they are mandatory tools that help you make test way easier.
